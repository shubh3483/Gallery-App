# Gallery-App

This is a gallery app which adds random images in the app fetched from the internet. In this project I learned how to fetch images directly from the internet and how to use Chips and how to make user to select those chips and adding it as a list on the main window on a card. I am also saving the state of the app so that the data is not lost. This is the same gallery app but now there are some MAJOR changes done to this to ease the use and add more functionalities.

Functionalities : 
1) Add random image from internet.
2) Add image from gallery.
3) Share image on another apps.
4) Implementation of Recycler view.
5) Search filter
6) Image cards can be sorted
7) Swipe to delete
8) Drag and drop.
