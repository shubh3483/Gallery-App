# Gallery-App

This is a gallery app which adds random images in the app fetched from the web. In this project I learned how to fetch images directly from the internet and how to use Chips and how to make user to select those chips and adding it as a list on the main window on a card. In this I have added the functionality of saving the data even after the app is closed and also on screen rotation.
